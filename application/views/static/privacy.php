We will not provide more information than is necessary to the service provider and will ensure that the information is returned or destroyed once the purpose for which it was given is filled.
            <br /><br />Our service providers may be located outside of Canada, and you acknowledge that personal information may be processed and stored in foreign jurisdictions and that the governments, courts or law enforcement or regulatory agencies in those jurisdictions may be able to obtain disclosure of that personal information through the laws of the foreign jurisdiction.

        <h3>ACCURACY</h3>

        <p>We will make a reasonable effort to ensure that personal information we are using or disclosing is accurate and complete.

We may charge you a reasonable fee for doing so.
            <br /><br />We will make the information available within 30 days of receiving a written request or provide written notice where additional time is required to fulfil the request.
            <br /><br />In some situations, we may not be able to provide access to certain personal information (e.g., if disclosure would reveal personal information about another individual, the personal information is protected by solicitor/client privilege, the information was collected for the purposes of an investigation or where disclosure of the information would reveal confidential commercial information that could harm our competitive position).  We may also be prevented by law from providing access to certain personal information.
            <br /><br />Where an access request is refused, we will notify you in writing, document the reasons for refusal and outline further steps which are available to you.
